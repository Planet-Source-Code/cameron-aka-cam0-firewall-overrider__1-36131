## Firewall Overrider


</div>

### Description

This code is a two piece program. Someone behind a router/firewall can load the client which connects to a specific IP. It connects to a remote computer and lets you take over the other computer through the firewall. Basicly like a Remote Access Tool, just with support of firewalls.
 
### More Info
 
This code is only for educational uses and is not to be used as in for hackerish purposes. I trust that all of you coders are smart.

Sometimes when a program is exited unexpectedly one side of the program may error and close.
